We are trying to employ "language-independent" metrics to build a tool that can judge "how well" a person says a given phrase in a target language and determines whether they are "improving" over time.

The intended application of this tool is for the [U.S. Peace Corps](http://peacecorps.gov) to use as part of a pre-departure training program for new Peace Corps Invitees.

This is an extension of the [Celebrate Language Audio Project](http://www.celebrate-language.com). The title "Applause" is a non-clever pun of the acronym for the project: CLAP.

This project draws from a variety of existing work, mostly from projects started at/worked on by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) faculty and students. Those works will be appropriately credited/listed below as we move along...
