| 11-9-13  | Finished Extracting mceps, AFs and f0s for all voices. Wrote a script called convert\_mceps\_to\_ascii.sh to convert binary mceps to ascii. Converted mceps to ascii for all speakers. | 8:00PM         | 1:45AM       | ~3 hours 45 minutes |
| 11-10-13 | Got DTW working. | 8:15PM         | 10:00PM      | 1 hour 45 minutes |
| 11-11-13 | Ran the script to get the DTW alignments on all speakers. Used the output of the script to generate aligned rms mceps for all speakers. | 6:00am (the next day) | 8:15am (the next day) | 2 hours 15 minutes |
| 11-12-13 | Started reconstructed all buggy voices and reruning all previously constructed scripts on each of the voices. | 10:30PM        | 12:00AM      | 90 minutes     |
